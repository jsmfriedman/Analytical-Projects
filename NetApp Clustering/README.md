This was a capstone project for my UT MSBA program, wherein my group worked with NetApp to help identify which companies were likely to soon migrate to the cloud. In addition to cleaning the raw data and feature engineering, we used clustering analysis to build descriptive profiles of the various companies likely to adopt cloud technology, and mapped non-cloud users to the clusters to identify which ones had profiles closely correlated with current on-cloud companies.

At NetApp's request, the original data has been excluded from these files.
